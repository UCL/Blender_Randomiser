### To install via Blender settings
1. Zip the following directory:
    `Blender_Randomiser/randomiser/`
2. Launch Blender
3. Navigate to Edit > Preferences
4. On the left-hand side panel, select 'Add-ons'
5. On the top-right select 'Install an add-on'
6. Browse to select the randomiser.zip file.
    - In the background, Blender will copy the file to the add-ons folder and unzip it
    - In MacOS, this add-on directory is usually located at:
        `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Blender/3.4/scripts/addons`
    (see [Blender directory layout](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html) for further details)

7. Click on the checkbox next to the installed add-on to enable it.
    - The add-on can be found by searching for 'randomisation' in the top right search bar.
    - Before searching, note that the checkbox to show enabled add-ons only ('Enabled Add-ons Only') may be selected!

> [!NOTE]
> - if you install an add-on, it will overwrite any pre-existing add-on with the same name.
> - Blender will only have access to the add-ons copied to any of the add-ons directories (see [Blender directory layout](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html)).
>- Remember that if you modify the code, you will need to create a new zip file with the latest version and repeat steps 1-7
