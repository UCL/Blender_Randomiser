# Adding materials and geometry panels

Materials and geometry panels are added to the UI if the node to be randomised is renamed with a prefix of "random". The node is then added to the panel and the user can select the min and max values for the randomisation. The user can also select the nodes to be randomised and the output file will contain the parameters that have been randomised.

## Materials
![Materials_panel](/docs/images/Materials_panel.png)
- A panel to randomise properties relative to the material nodes:
    - nodes and node groups are aggregated based on the material they belong to.
    - only materials with use_nodes=True are added to the panel. By default, use_nodes is set to True, but this is a convenient way to add/remove materials from the panel.
    - If new nodes that are marked for randomisation are added or deleted, these appear automatically in the randomisation panel.
    - Recursive node groups are accepted.
    - Convenience functions were added to visualise the node graph per material, constrain the min and max values for the randomisation and unselect nodes that are candidates for randomisation but are unlinked.

### When is a new material slot automatically added?
Clicking the name of the material in a subpanel header shows its node graph. If a material is clicked and it has no slot assigned, a new slot will be created for it


## Geometry
![Geometry_panel](/docs/images/Geometry_panel.png)

- A panel to randomise properties relative to the geometry nodes:
    - nodes are aggregated based on the node group they belong to.
    - Same functionalities as in material nodes panel: new or deleted nodes are automatically added, recursive node groups are accepted,etc.


An example of a cube object:

An example of a sphere object with recursive node groups:
![Geometry_sphere_recursive_example](/docs/images/Geometry_SPHERE_node_group_within_node_group.png)

>[!NOTE]
> Only the geometry linked to the current active selective object is visible via the node graph view

### When is a new modifier automatically added to an objectâ€™s geometry?
If a geometry node group is not inside another node group, and is not linked to a modifier of the currently active object, a new modifier is created and the geometry node group is linked to it.

This example panel set-up for geometry and materials can produce an [output_file](/output_randomisations_per_frame1697817956.010714_mat_geom_example.json)
